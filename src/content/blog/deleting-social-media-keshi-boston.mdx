If you're reading this, welcome to my first life-related post! This will be my way of sharing what's going on in my life. These posts will be like handwritten letters to friends and family. Also, I'd like to improve my writing to share my thoughts in a more concise and clear manner.

## Deleting Social Media

Lately, I've felt the urge to delete all social media. I've developed a strong aversion towards the addictive nature of social media applications. I found that their common goal is to get you to spend as much time on them as possible. They steal your time by using information gathered about you and profit off of it. Because of this, I've deleted Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram.

At first, it was difficult deleting these applications. I had spent a considerable amount of time on them in the past. Also, I had friends and family that I kept in contact with through them. But, I thought about it for a moment:

> If a friend or family member wants to reach me, they know how to reach me.

By deleting these social media applications, my attention isn't diverted across many platforms. If I'd like to have a conversation with someone, I'll text or call them. It's that simple.

I still enjoy platforms like Twitter <span class="i-carbon-logo-twitter"></span> and Mastodon <span class="i-carbon-logo-mastodon"></span>, though. They allow you to meet like-minded people and actually make friends on the internet. Although, my thoughts on those platforms could change in the future.

## Keshi

This past March, I went to a Keshi concert with two friends, Keven and Brandon. Keven had never listened to a Keshi song in his life, but we convinced him to come with us <span class="i-twemoji-face-with-tears-of-joy"></span>. Here are some photos from the concert!

## Boston Trip 04/02/2023

Turns out, I'm not too bad at planning trips. Parking in Providence, RI is free on Sundays. Also, the MBTA has a $10 weekend pass that gives you unlimited rides to and from Providence and Boston. So, I took the opportunity to visit Boston. I went to a coffee shop called Ogawa Coffee, coded/played some chess, visited Quincy Market, got pizza, went to Boston Common, got bubble tea, and went home!

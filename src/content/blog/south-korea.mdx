I studied Korean for 20 days and traveled to Seoul, South Korea! I spent around 1 hour each morning studying. My sister is from Seoul and this trip was in the works for a long time. As of this post, I’m still a beginner in Korean. But, I sure learned a lot! I enjoyed the experience of traveling to a new country and appreciating their culture.

In this post, I’ll talk about all the places my family and I visited. Also, we’ll dive into all the Korean I learned leading up to and during my trip to Seoul, South Korea.

# Seoul, South Korea Trip Itinerary

I am by no means a travel blogger. I didn’t take many notes during the trip because I like enjoying the moment. In fact, I almost never take pictures but I’m trying to be better about it. Most of the photos I have from the trip are stolen from my sister 😂.

Below are all the notable places we visited. Our visit was five days long, with two days for travel. I recommend you check these out if you visit Seoul! For transportation, buy yourself a T-Money Card. It's a prepaid public transportation card for cities across South Korea. You can buy one at Incheon Airport, in convenience stores, or in public transportation stations.

Also, one of the nights I took the metro to the Gangnam district. I went to a language exchange meetup from [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) where I met some awesome people living in South Korea (both natives and foreigners). They gave me great tips and suggestions on where to visit!

- Incheon Airport (where we arrived)
- Somerset Palace (hotel)
- Hongik University
    - Campus and shopping areas around the university
- Bukchon Hanok Village
- Seoul Tower
    - Definitely take the cable car up to visit this!
- War Memorial of Korea
- Lotus Lantern Festival
- Jogyesa Temple and various palaces
    - Remember to be respectful!
- Gwangjang market
- Cheonggyecheon stream
- COEX mall
- Insadong
- Myeongdong shopping district
- Lots of good food spots!

# 20 Days of Korean

As soon as I started learning Korean I added the 2-set Korean keyboard to my MacBook for ease of use. To switch back and forth between the US keyboard to the Korean keyboard, I hot-keyed it to `cmd` + `.`. I also added this keyboard on my phone. This allowed me to use the Korean alphabet easily. I used both Duolingo and Billy Go’s Korean beginner series on YouTube to learn Korean!

If you have an advanced level of Korean and find any mistakes in this post, please feel free to let me know! This blog is all open source and I welcome any constructive feedback.

In all my examples, I try to avoid romanization as much as possible. I recommend you learn the Korean alphabet and how to pronounce each letter. In fact, in Billy Go’s Korean beginner YouTube series they do just that!

# Billy Go’s Beginner Korean Course

## Course Intro (Ep 1)

- How to read and write
- Introduce yourself
- Likes and dislikes
- Asking questions
- Requests
- Explanations
- Describing
- Talk about what someone is doing
- Time, numbers, and dates
- Culture and customs

## Intro to 한글 (Ep 2)

There are 14 consonants and 10 vowels. Romanization is bad because it doesn’t accurately represent the Korean language. The stroke order when writing each letter in Korean is very important. You should draw from left to right and top to bottom.

### Vowels

Writing a consonant by itself has no sound. You need a consonant with a vowel. As noted before, the romanizations don’t accurately represent the phonetics of the language.

- ㅏ - “ah”
- ㅗ - like “o” “oh” in “oak tree”
- ㅓ - like “eo”
- ㅜ - “u”
- ㅡ - “eu”
- ㅣ - “eee” like the French pronunciation of “i”
- ㅔ - “aye” “e”
- ㅐ - “ae” pronounced same as ㅔ
- ㅑ - “ya”
- ㅕ - “yeo”
- ㅛ - “yo”
- ㅠ -  “yu”
- ㅖ - “ye”
- ㅒ - “yae” pronounced same as ㅖ

### Consonants

Whenever you have a ㅅ and it’s before a vowel with an ㅣ sound, it sounds more like “sh.” This applies toㅣ and all the “y” sounding vowels.

- ㄱ - like a “k” or a “g” sound
- ㄴ - like a “n”
- ㄷ - like a “t” or a “d”
- ㄹ - like in the middle of a “l” or “r” (position tongue where you’d say in d in dog, but try a “l” sound)
- ㅁ - kind of like an “m” but softer
- ㅂ - kind of like a “p” or a “b”
- ㅅ - like an “s” sound
- ㅈ -  closer to a “j” or “ch”
- ㅎ - closer to “h”
- ㅇ - when it’s directly in front of a vowel, there is no sound and we just use the sound of the vowel. At the end of a syllable block, has an “ng” sound.

### Syllables

Consonants and vowels come together to form syllables. In total There are 6 types of syllable blocks. Here are some examples:

- 가
- 요
- 유
- 야
- 여
- 에
- 나
- 다
- 라
- 마
- 바
- 사
- 자
- 하
- 고
- 아 (we can hear the vowel completely)
- 오
- 간 (vertical vowel w/ 2 consonants)
- 곤 (horizontal vowel w/ 2 consonants)
- 어
- 우
- 으

## Continued Learning of 한글 - First Letters (Ep 3)

## Continued Learning of 한글 - New Kinds of Syllables (Ep 4)

## Continued Learning of 한글 - More Vowels (Ep 5)

## Continued Learning of 한글 - More Syllables (Ep 6)

Blending syllables when pronouncing:

- 한국인 (2nd syllable block will blend into the 3rd)
- 미국은
- 닫아
- 한국어

3 consonants and one vertical vowel, 3 consonants with horizontal vowel:

- 앉
- 긁

How to read ㄹ:

- When the syllable has two consonants at the bottom:
    - and one of them is ㄹ…
    - and the following syllable does not start with ㅇ
    - most of the time, ㄹ is not pronounced
- 삶
- 흙
- 밟

## ****Learning 한글 Double and Strong Consonants (Ep 7)****

### Double Consonants

Double consonants take up the same space as one normal consonant. They are pronounced the same way as their normal forms, but you tense your mouth a bit before pronouncing them. Try it by pausing a bit before pronouncing it. It’s easier to practice double consonants with actual words. Like 아가 vs 아까.

Hold up a tissue paper in front of your mouth when practicing:

- Regular consonants the tissue paper should move noticeably
- Double consonants the **tissue paper should not move** noticeably (due to tensing)

Examples:

- ㄲ
- 까
- 따
- 빠
- 싸
- 짜

### Strong Consonants

Strong constants as the name suggests have a much stronger sound. There are only 4. They’re pronounced the same as the normal versions, but with more force.

Hold up a tissue paper in front of your mouth when practicing:

- With regular consonants the tissue paper should move noticeably
- With strong consonants the **tissue paper move more noticeably**

Examples:

- 카
- 타
- 파 (strong version of ㅂ)
- 차

## ****Learning 한글 Diphthongs (Ep 8)****

Diphthongs are a fancy name for a vowel which is a combination of two vowels. Simply say the first vowel on the left followed by the vowel on the right quickly.

- ㅢ “u i”
    - 의
    - Whenever this is used with any other consonant, it gets simplified to the ㅣ sound. 희 is an example.
- ㅘ “o a” → “wa”
    - 와
- ㅝ “u eo” → “woe”
    - 워
- ㅟ “u i” → “wi”
    - 위
- ㅙ “o ae” → “wae”
    - 왜
- ㅚ
    - 외
    - This one is a trick, it’s not a combo of “o” and “i.” It’s a combo of ㅗ and ㅔ “we” same as “wae.”
- ㅞ “u e” → “we” same as “wae”
    - 웨

To pronounce the names of the consonants themselves (also applies to strong consonants) we take the consonant and attach the vowel ㅣ. Then you attach the syllable 으, followed by the same consonant at the bottom. For example, 리을. **Here are 3 irregulars**:

- ㄱ = 기역
- ㄷ = 디귿
- ㅅ = 시옷

For double consonants, take the normal form and then add 쌍:

- ㅆ = 쌍시옷
- ㄲ = 쌍기역

Vowels are just pronounced as they are written, but you’d add the ㅇ consonant before them to make a syllable.

## Sound Change Rules for 한글 (Episode 9)

맛이 - “ma shi”

But, how would you pronounce just 맛? It’s pronounced more like “maht.” We don’t want to add extra sounds for the ㅅ consonant.

Sound change rules make Korean sound smoother. Websites like “Naver” have all pronunciations if you are even unsure: https://korean.dict.naver.com/koendict/#/main.

1. **Consonant at the bottom of a syllable**

These consonants become pronounced as the consonant, ㄷ:

ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ, ㅌ, ㅎ

- 맛 = 맏
- 밌 = 믿
- 갖 = 갇
- 및 = 믿
- 밭 = 받
- 낳 = 낟

This makes these syllables possible to pronounce. Other consonants that can be pronounced as-is do not become pronounced as ㄷ: ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ,  and ㅇ.

2.  **Pronouncing ㄲ, ㅋ, and ㅍ**
- When a syllable ends with the following consonants:
    - ㄲ, ㅋ, and ㅍ
- These consonants become pronounced as their regular versions.
    - 겪 = 격
    - 부엌 = 부억
    - 잎 = 입

This makes these syllables possible to pronounce. 

3. **Between two syllables**
- When the 1st syllable ends with any consonant sound (besides ㅁ, ㄴ, or ㄹ)…
    - 학, 받, 백, 극, etc.
- And the 2nd syllable begins with any of the following 5 consonants: ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ.
- Then the 2nd syllables consonant becomes pronounced as a double consonant.
    - 학교 = 학꾜
    - 받다 = 받따
    - 었던 = 었떤
4. **Pronouncing ㅎ**
- When ㅎ is between two syllables and before ㅇ, the sound of ㅎ disappears.
    - 싫어 = 시러
    - 많아 = 마나
    - 좋아 = 조아
- If a regular consonant comes before or after ㅎ, it becomes pronounced as a strong consonant.
    - 많다 = 만타
    - 잃다 = 일타
    - 착하다 = 차카다
5. **Pronouncing ㄹ**
- When the 1st syllables ends with ㄹ and the 2nd syllable beings with the following consonant:
    - ㄱ, ㄷ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅈ
- The 2nd syllable usually becomes pronounced as a double consonant.

yes:

- 밀당 = 밀땅
- 일자리 = 일짜리
- 물가 = 물까

no:

- 얼굴
- 웰빙
- 알바
6. **Pronouncing ㅂ**

    - 볶는 = 봉는
8. **Pronouncing ㄴ/ㅁ**
- When the 2nd syllable begins with the consonant ㄴ/ㅁ and the 1st syllable ends with ㄷ,ㅅ, ㅈ, or ㅎ:
    - 몇년 = 면년
    - 맞나 = 만나
    - 잇몸 = 인몸
9. **More ㄹ Changes Part 1**
- When the 1st syllable ends with a ㅂ sound and the 2nd syllable starts with a ㄹ sound:
- The ㅂ gets pronounced as ㅁ, and the ㄹ gets pronounced as ㄴ.
    - 합량 = 함녕
    - 압력 = 암녁
    - 십리 = 심니
10. **More ㄹ Changes Part 2**
- When the 1st syllable ends with a ㄱ sound and the 2nd syllable begins with the consonant ㄹ:
- The ㄱ becomes pronounced as ㅇ and the ㄹ is pronounced like ㄴ.
    - 백리 = 뱅니
    - 식량 - 싱냥
    - 막료 = 망뇨

    - 맏이 = 마지
    - 같이 = 가
    - 붙여 = 부쳐

## Hello and Goodbye (Episode 10)

In this episode, I learned a little history. Originally, Korea was one country but split after the Korean war. Both sides speak Korean, but differently.

- South Korea (한국)
- Population: 50+ million
- Capital: 성울
- Language spoken: 한국어

Korean sentence structure is different than English. It’s subject, object, verb (SOV).

- Hello to close friends or same age as you or younger: 안녕
- Hello to anyone else: 안녕하세요 (you have to slightly bow when you say this)

Korea also has a different perspective on your age. Everyone is born 1 year old (basically 1 indexed). Everyone gains 1 year of age on Jan 1. Birthdays are celebrated, but it doesn’t mean you gain a year in Korean age.

- Goodbye to to close friends or same age as you or younger = 안녕
- Goodbye to someone going somewhere = 안녕히 가세요 (go in peace)
- Goodbye to someone staying somewhere = 안녕히 계세요 (stay in peace)

## Introducing Yourself (Episode 11)

Bow slightly when meeting someone. The deeper the bow, the more respect is shown.

- Formal or business: bow at a 45 degree angle. shaking hands is alright too. Hold your elbow with the other hand when shaking hands.
- Everyday: bow your head and body slightly
- Friends: don’t bow

How to say “I am”

- 저는 … 이에요 (used after consonant)
- 저는 … 예요 (used after a vowel and pronounced as 에요)
- 저는 맥스예요 = I’m Max

How to say “nice to meet you”

- To people who look to be a similar age as you or younger, in casual situations = 반가워요
- To anyone else in any situation = 반갑습니다 (pronounced like 반갑씀니다)

## Saying Thanks/You’re Welcome (Episode 12)

- 고마워 = Thank you to close friends the same age as you or younger
- 고마워요 = Thank you to people who look to be a similar age as you or younger, in casual situations
- 감사함니다 = Thank you to anyone else, in any other situation
- 아니야 = You’re welcome to close friends the same age as you or younger
- 아니에요 = You’re welcome to to anyone else, in any other situation
- 아닙니다 = You’re welcome in a very formal situation

## Excuse Me (Episode 13)

To get a stranger’s attention (such as a waiter at a restaurant):

- 여기요 = Over here (hey you, over here)
    - 요 is added for politeness
- 저기요 = Over there (hey you over there)

To apologize in advance for being impolite or interrupting someone, or at the start of a sentence:

- 실례합나다 = Excuse me
- 실례지만 = Excuse me but…

To move past someone or a crowd:

- 잠시만요 = Excuse me
    - Means ‘only a brief moment’

## Intro to Verbs (Episode 14)

Like English, Korean verbs will be conjugated when used in a sentence. Every Korean verb ends with 다 in its infinitive form. Also, Korean sentence structure is SOV (subject object verb). Here are some examples:

- 가다 = to go
- 먹다 = to eat
- 좋아하다 =  to like
- 보다 = to see
- 이다 = to be
    - Note, this is not an action verb because it doesn’t do any action. It’s a descriptive verb.

Unlike English, Korean verbs conjugate the same for different subject pronouns. So you conjugate things the same for ‘I’, ‘You’, ‘We’, and more. But, they obviously conjugate differently for different tenses. Let’s conjugate two verbs in the present tense:

- To go = 가다 → 가요
- To be = 이다 → 이에요 or 예요
- 저는 max 예요 = I’m max
- 저는 가요  = I go
- 저는 피자를 먹어요 = I eat pizza
    - 를/을 is an object marker that’s used whenever a verb has an object - whenever a verb is doing something to someone or something

## I Want (Episode 15)

Note: this is only for if ‘I’ or ‘you’ want something. Billy also mentioned there’s a shortened way of saying these.

- First grammar form - 고 싶다
- Verb stem + 고 싶다

### Wanting to do something

A verb stem is when we take an un-conjugated verb, and remove the 다 from the end.

- 가다 → 가 = To go verb stem
- 이다 → 이 = To be verb stem

To say that you ‘want to’ do a verb, attach 고 싶다 to the verb stem.

- 가고 싶다 =  To want to go
- 머고 싶다 = To want to eat

But, 싶다 is also a verb and you need to conjugate that too.

- 가고 싶다 → 가고 **싶어요**
- 먹거 싶다  → 먹고 **싶어요**

### Wanting something

Noun + 을/를 가지고 싶다

- 가지고 means ‘to have’ or ‘to carry with you.’
- 을 object marker after consonant, 를 after a vowel
- 저는 비빔밥을 가지고 싶어요 = I want bibimbap

## The Object Marker (Episode 16)

The object marker always attaches directly after a noun (person/place/thing). It marks the object of an action verb. It shows who or what a verb is doing something to. We use the 을 object marker after consonant and the 를 object marker after a vowel.

- 저는 한글을 배우고 싶어요 = I want to learn hangul
    - 배우다  = To learn

## The Topic Marker (Episode 17)

Before, we only really used it for 저는. 저 is a pronoun that means ‘I’ or ‘me.’ The topic marker literally marks the topic of the conversation.

It could be described as kind of like: “when it comes to X,” “on the topic of X,” or “as for X.”

- 저는 = “as for me…” or “when it comes to me…”

Once the topic is set with the topic marker it’s not necessary to repeat it unless you want to change the topic.

## This and That (Episode 18)

We previously learned about 이다 for introducing ourselves and that it’s the verb “to be.”

- 저는 맥스예요 = I’m Max
- 저는 석진이에요 = I’m Sogjin

To say “this,” we say 이. This is an adjective and is used directly before a noun. We also use it to talk about objects close to the speaker.

- 이 음악 = this music

How to say “that” we say 그. We’d use this whenever an object is closer to the listener not the speaker.

- 그 영화 = that movie

We can also say “that” with 저.  We’d use this whenever an object is not close to the listener or the speaker.

- 저 티비 = that TV

For “this thing,” we can use 이것. The same rules apply. It’s a noun and can be used like one.

For “that thing,” we can use 그것. The same rules apply. It’s a noun and can be used like one.

- 이것은 티비여요 = This is a television
- 그것은 티비여요 = That is a television
- 저것은 영화여요 = That is a movie over there

To wrap things up, 이, 그, and 저  are adjectives - they must be used before a noun. 이갓, 그것, and 저것  are nous - they can be used on their own (such as w/ the topic marker or object marker). Also, when speaking these 3 can be shortened to 이거, 그거, 저거, but all work.

## The Particle 도 (Episode 19)

We’ve already learned some particles before like the topic and object markers. 도 means “even,” “also,” or “too.” It can be added directly to any noun. It’s not used by itself.

When used after a noun 도 replaces any markers.

- 저도 = Me too, even me, also me
- 저도, 커피를 마시고 싶어요 = I want to drink coffee too
    - 마시다 = To drink

## Introduction to Conjugation (Episode 20)

To use a Korean verb, you have to conjugate it from its infinitive form. All verbs end with 다. So for example, we learned these verbs:

- 가다 → 가요 = To go
- 먹다 → 먹어요 = To eat
- 좋아하다 → 좋아해요 =  To like
- 보다 → 봐요 = To see
- 이다 → 이에요 or 예요 = To be

Even though Korean verbs conjugate the same for different subject pronouns, we don’t get off scot-free. Korean has seven different speech levels! These levels are demonstrated in the verb endings. There are three speech levels that are used most often: formal speech, polite/standard speech, or casual/informal speech.

The above example conjugations are all in present tense informal form. As mentioned, there are 3 categories of formal, casual, and informal. To be technical, the are 7 politeness forms and also honorifics!

## Conclusion

Although it was only 20 days of studying Korean, I sure learned a whole lot. Seoul was so cool and I’d definitely travel there again. Anyways, thank you for reading this life-related post about travel and language learning! Once I figure out setting up Cloudflare I'll be creating a "Photos" section to my last couple posts (it's updated now!). Hope to catch you in the next blog post!

Best,

Max

In addition to leveling, mastering the fundamentals of mixing involves four key elements:

1. **EQ (Equalization)** - EQ shapes instrument tones by boosting or cutting specific frequencies. For instance, enhance the high frequencies for vocals or high hats, but avoid them on a kick drum to maintain a solid foundation.
2. **Compression** - Compression balances volume by reducing loud peaks and boosting softer elements. Applied to drums or vocals, it ensures a consistent sound, adding punch and cohesion to the mix.
3. **Reverb** - Reverb adds space and ambiance, simulating different environments. Apply it subtly to vocals for depth or on a snare for a tight studio feel, creating a natural and immersive sound.
4. **Delay** - Delay introduces echoes, adding depth and dimension. Use it on guitars or vocals for a spacious effect, adjusting delay times and feedback for creative enhancements.

Understanding these four elements—EQ, compression, reverb, and delay—lays the groundwork for crafting a professional and balanced mix, enhancing the quality of your music.

## What is mixing?

Taking multiple tracks and making them work/mix together is mixing. This involves turning the volume up/down on certain tracks to be level (leveling).

Also, having a north star of a production grade song for reference is always good. Pick a song of a similar vibe, and use that as comparison.

## What mixing won’t do

Mixing won’t fix a bad song. Before you start mixing, all the pieces of your song should be in place from a production standpoint. For example, all instruments should be recorded and the song should be structurally complete.

## Keep an eye on the stereo output decibels

The stereo output serves as the channel for all audio in the mix. Monitoring the stereo decibel output is crucial, indicating the overall volume of the song. Maintaining a level around `-0.5db` to `-0.6db` which is in the green ensures optimal headroom and space for subsequent mastering processes.

## Helpful tips for organization

- Utilize markers to delineate song sections such as verses, pre-choruses, choruses, and bridges. Begin mixing by focusing on specific sections. You could start with the most prominent, like the chorus. Or, picking the loudest section first is also a good strategy.
- Similarly, we can group tracks. For instance, combine drums, guitar, vocals, bass, etc. To create a track stack, use the “Create Track Stack” option in the right-click dropdown menu or **`shift`** + **`option`** + **`d`**. Folder stacks are ideal for organization, while a summing stack enables global effects, optimizing CPU usage since we won’t have an effect individually on each track.
- Simplify navigation and visual clarity by color coding tracks. Use **`option`** + **`c`** to apply colors either by selecting tracks or dragging over them. Additionally, assign meaningful names to your tracks for a cohesive and organized workflow.

## Mixing drums

Everything should be mixed in accordance to the drums since we start with them. After, we mix the bass in so it sounds good with the drums, then the guitars, the synths and keys, the vocals, atmospheric sounds, and more.

We start by solo’ing off tracks. For example, we solo the kick and observe the leveling that it peaks at (look at the stereo output decibels). Make sure all your effects are on point on the solo’d track. In fact, there are a lot of presets on effects that you can choose that will help out. These very subtle effects will add up in the song as a whole.

When it comes to effects, rely on the foundational elements of mixing: EQ, compression, reverb, and delay. It's not necessary to employ all these effects in every instance; experimentation with different combinations can yield diverse and creative outcomes.

### Kick

- Mixing a kick drum involves using EQ to shape its tones, applying compression for a consistent volume and punch, and introducing subtle reverb for space without muddying the mix. Adjust settings based on the kick's characteristics and overall mix context.

Next, after the effects have been added to the kick, we want to level our kick. We turn it down until we have enough headroom on it. Like before, you want it around `-0.5db` to `-0.6db`. Also, use your headphones to judge this well.

### Snares

- EQ to remove low-end frequencies, compression for consistency, subtle reverb for dimension (usually more than the kick to add room presence). Adjust settings thoughtfully, considering the desired spatial impact within the mix.

To mix the snare with the kick, you kind of do it by ear changing the levels of both of them to your liking while keeping the overall stereo output around `-0.5db` to `-0.6db`.

### Hats

- EQ to remove low-end frequencies, compression for consistency, subtle reverb for dimension.

To mix the hats in with the snare/kick, you also just listen by ear/feel to make sure it all sounds good while keeping it at that overall stereo output decibel level. Keep in mind you can go back and adjust the leveling kick/snare too while also adjusting the hats.

### Overall

After you’re done mixing all the drums, feel free to add effects on the grouping as a whole. For example, you could add some distortion (makes it more punchy), slight compression, or slight reverb. Note, echo isn’t normally added on drums but you could experiment with it. Take all the outputs of the underlying tracks, putting it through a bus, and adding the effects on top of that. If the mix sounds good but there’s not enough headroom, you can lower the decibel level on the overall grouping.

This meticulous approach to drum mixing ensures each element contributes to a cohesive and impactful rhythm section. Remember to trust your ears and make adjustments based on the overall sound you aim to achieve.

## Mixing electric bass

- Apply effects and then level

Add your effects on the bass. For EQ’ing a bass guitar usually you don’t want to cut out a lot of lows. Just enough of a low eq cut to shape the frequency. If you don’t cut out the low ends on your tracks, those signals will affect your compressor bc it will increase them. Arrange effects with subtractive processes at the top for organizational clarity. Keep the whole drum group going/selected as you start mixing the bass and adjust the levels accordingly.

You can also side-chain your bass to your kick. What this means is you’re connecting your kick drum to your bass guitar. It’s very common to side-chain a kick with another instrument that shares those frequencies. Whenever the kick hits, you’ll want that space for the kick. But when the bass guitar comes in you also would like to hear that. What side-chaining does is whenever the kick happens, the bass guitar will just get a little bit quieter so you’ll hear more of the kick than you do the bass. You do it with multi-band compression. You can choose to sidechain inside the configuration of the compression effect on the bass. If you’re adding reverb probably add as much as the others so it sounds like its in the same room as the other instruments.

## Mixing electric guitar

- Apply effects and then level

If you have some hits on bass notes you could side-chain it with the kick again so it doesn’t overpower it. A strategy is to look away from the screen and move to level accordingly as you’re listening to choose the best spot you feel.

## Mixing Synths/Keys

- Apply effects and then level

If using preset instruments, you don’t need to adjust the effects much, given stock compression and EQ. Utilize Logic's cycle feature to ensure proper starting points for your mix.

Reverb adds spatial context, influencing perception of depth in the mix. Keep main song elements centered, enhancing focus. When panning, consider creating a stage-like atmosphere; for instance, pan a Wurlitzer Modern keyboard slightly left to envision a band on stage. Experiment with panning for different keys/synths to achieve a balanced spatial arrangement.

## **Mixing Vocals**

- Apply effects and then level.

For background vocals, consider adding subtle echoes to create depth. Adjust levels accordingly for a harmonious blend within the mix.

## Mixing atmospheric and background noise

You can use automation to have the audio come in and out and not be at just a certain level. For example, let’s say we had some background coffee shop chatter in the background. You could use automation to make that sound come in and out at a low volume throughout the track. This can be done w/ the automation view. You’d choose to automate the volume (default) and then click to add a baseline audio level. You can click to add different points on the line and drag them around. Or you could use “T-Latch” and play the audio section, changing the level as it plays and Logic will auto add the points for you.

## Adding automation to your mixes

You can use automation to control the audio's volume dynamically, allowing it to fade in and out rather than remain at a fixed level. For instance, imagine having background coffee shop chatter in a track. Automation enables you to seamlessly adjust the volume of this sound throughout the track. This can be achieved through the automation view. Select volume (default) for automation, then click to set a baseline audio level. Add different points on the line and adjust them by dragging. Alternatively, use "T-Latch" to play the audio section, changing the level as it plays, and let Logic automatically add the points for you.

## Conclusion

Incorporate these fundamental mixing principles to sculpt a professional and balanced sound in your music production journey. Mastering EQ, compression, reverb, and delay empowers you to create impactful mixes that elevate your music to new heights.
